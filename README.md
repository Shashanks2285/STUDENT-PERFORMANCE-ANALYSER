# Machine Learning Project: Students Performance in Exams

## Overview

This repository contains the code and resources for a machine learning project aimed at predicting students' performance in exams based on various factors. The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle and contains information on students’ exam scores across different subjects. The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that can predict students’ performance based on features such as gender, race/ethnicity, parental level of education, lunch, test preparation course, and study hours.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is titled **"Students Performance in Exams"** and can be found on Kaggle at [this link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/spscientist/students-performance-in-exams?datasetId=74977).

### Data Description

The dataset consists of the following columns:

- **gender**: The gender of the student (Male/Female).
- **race/ethnicity**: The race or ethnicity group of the student (categorical).
- **parental level of education**: The highest level of education attained by the student’s parents (e.g., some college, high school, associate's degree, etc.).
- **lunch**: The type of lunch the student receives (Standard or Free/Reduced).
- **test preparation course**: Whether the student completed a test preparation course before the exam (Yes or No).
- **hours studied**: The number of hours the student spent studying for the exam (numerical value).
- **math score**: The score obtained by the student in the Math exam (numerical value).
- **reading score**: The score obtained by the student in the Reading exam (numerical value).
- **writing score**: The score obtained by the student in the Writing exam (numerical value).

### Target Variable

The target variable for this project is the **exam score** across the subjects: **Math**, **Reading**, and **Writing**. The project focuses on predicting these scores based on the given features in the dataset.

## Project Objective

The main objective of this project is to apply machine learning techniques to predict students’ exam performance based on various factors, such as demographics and study habits. The project involves:

- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing the data for analysis and modeling.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyzing the dataset to understand patterns, distributions, and relationships between features.
- **Feature Engineering**: Selecting and transforming features to enhance the performance of the machine learning models.
- **Model Training and Evaluation**: Applying different machine learning algorithms to predict students’ scores and evaluating model performance.
- **Result Visualization**: Visualizing the results and model performance using various plots and graphs.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into several sections:

- **Data Collection**: The data is sourced from Kaggle and has been pre-processed for analysis.
- **Data Preprocessing**: The data is cleaned by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualization techniques like histograms, box plots, and correlation heatmaps are used to explore the data.
- **Feature Engineering**: Feature selection and transformation steps are applied to enhance model performance.
- **Modeling**: Several machine learning algorithms are tested, including linear regression, decision trees, random forests, and support vector machines.
- **Model Evaluation**: The models are evaluated using performance metrics such as accuracy, mean squared error (MSE), and R² score.

## Technologies Used

This project uses a combination of the following technologies:

- **Python**: The primary programming language used for data analysis and modeling.
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: A development environment for running the code interactively.
- **Libraries**:
  - `pandas` for data manipulation.
  - `numpy` for numerical operations.
  - `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for data visualization.
  - `scikit-learn` for machine learning algorithms and model evaluation.

## Workflow

The workflow of the project can be broken down into the following key steps:

1. **Data Import and Preprocessing**: Import the dataset and clean the data by handling missing values and encoding categorical features.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Analyze the data distribution, visualize the relationship between features, and identify patterns.
3. **Feature Selection and Engineering**: Choose relevant features and perform any necessary transformations (e.g., scaling).
4. **Model Training**: Train multiple machine learning models, such as linear regression, decision trees, random forests, etc.
5. **Model Evaluation**: Assess the performance of each model using various evaluation metrics like accuracy, mean squared error, and R² score.
6. **Result Visualization**: Visualize the model performance and predictions with graphs.

## Project Goals

- **Understand the Impact of Different Features**: Analyze how factors like gender, parental education level, and hours studied impact students’ performance.
- **Build Predictive Models**: Develop machine learning models that can predict the exam scores of students based on the available features.
- **Compare Model Performance**: Test different machine learning algorithms and compare their performance in predicting students’ exam scores.

## Future Improvements

There are several potential improvements for this project, such as:

- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimizing the machine learning models to improve accuracy and performance.
- **Model Deployment**: Deploying the best-performing model as a web application or API for real-time predictions.
- **Additional Data Collection**: Expanding the dataset by including more features, such as students’ attendance, prior knowledge, or external factors affecting performance.
- **Advanced Models**: Experimenting with deep learning techniques or more complex models like XGBoost to enhance prediction accuracy.
